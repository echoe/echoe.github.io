So. I quit my job, and did the things I said I'd do. But then I also ... just kept interviewing, instead of taking a longer break. Which in retrospect seems like somewhat of a mistake. And in the middle of recovering from surgery, I ... got another job.
I'm really torn on it. I enjoy the money, but a lot of the process is really ... arduous. I've already gotten tired of what the job asks from me, which is almost entirely 'repair our tech debt, which is insurmountable'. There seems to be a lot of ... required failure, as nothing is explained, and I'm incredibly unused to being as much of a minority as I am within the team (which ... one thing I've noticed is that the further I scale the "career ladder", the less women there are ... so that sucks ... but I was not expecting being white to also confer minority status, so that's new?).

It also feels like I don't know how to take a useful vacation, as well - if I take a break and come back, something I don't know immediately crops up, and something that requires work expands, and ... everything is just as heavy as it was before. It may be that Devops, the job itself ... generally burns people out and makes taking a break seem impossible. I'm not sure if this is isolated to this specific Devops job, or it is just isolated to 'bad' Devops jobs, or if it's a general feature of Devops. I know that I didn't feel that way in my prior job. But I'm ... unsure, really.

This job has also been a lot of new things. Generally this is fantastic - and I do have enough expertise now in production to say that I can do several fun cloud buzzwords now, which is great for my career at least! - but they're all fairly unstructured. Though I came in with very little knowledge of many of those things, it has felt like I've been assumed to have full knowledge of everything so everything I've learned has to a point been ... self-learning, but without having a real dev space to learn within, kind of on the fly. I've also noticed that having to learn a ton of different things that are undescribed ... generally doesn't combine well with imposter syndrome (which everybody in the space has, 100%, and I am /definitely/ not an exception).

... So. Money is good, at least! I'll continue to do it until I literally can't, maybe. Or until I can figure out how to manage my burnout better. Or until I can find a job where there are less constant imposter syndrome triggers, and a more diverse team environment. We'll see.

Next post is going to be about some JQ stuff I've done within this job - probably the thing I enjoyed doing the most, though it took a long time and probably isn't terribly useful in the long term - but hopefully that's useful to some people? I'm also hoping to create some things this weekend or next, but ... this is always,
always,
always ...
a process.
