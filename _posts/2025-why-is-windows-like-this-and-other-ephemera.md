It's been a minute! I wanted to just quickly update with two (2) things. 

First, and probably most importantly, in another episode of 'Posting about bullshit I've found out on the internet', Windows has an option to reduce fan noise built into it that everyone can use.
As someone who really, really cares about fan noise, this is absolutely massive???
It's mentioned here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/passive-and-active-cooling-modes
To enable seeing it as an option you have to edit the Windows Registry like this:

I did this tweak and my laptop simply stopped doing the fan noise hiss at me. That's all I really want. Why is this so difficult to get otherwise?!?! And why is this option /hidden/?? Seriously???
... Windows is ... exasperating sometimes. But MacOS charges so much for storage that I've started to get used to Windows again.

Anyways, in other news ... I've been on my sabbatical for a full year now (as of today).

However, due to [gestures at world], I've been looking for a job for, oh, a month now? I was anxious that it may be a little more difficult than it would've been when I left.
And I ... was correct!

I've been able to get a few interviews. But it's been harder to find slots than I expected as someone with my experience, even with the weakness of the general market.
I think ... that the market niche I was trying to get into when I went fully into Cloud - Cloud Architect and Cloud Engineer, Platform Engineer, that species of devops engineer - is one where the market is /very/ soft right now.
People are looking for things on either end of the market instead. They're looking for full Python coding, DevOps on premises - which I can do, I've just been working in the cloud for the last five years instead - or they're looking for AI.
So. I still have some irons in the fire. But if every iron comes out cold, I might see if I can do some quick reskilling. Get back on the horse there, and go forwards, knowing where I have to go.

Onwards and upwards. ... With a laptop that doesn't make constant fan noise. :)
