I've started to make a podcast! Lots of work is needed for these things ... and I am finding that out, heh.
Even though the logo is being made, we have a name, and a good concept ... but now we have to ... make it. And promote it. So many things.
I've bought a URL and have set up the initial website with a little information, but haven't actually set up the site yet myself. Going to learn gatsby over the weekend, and once I do that it'll look much better. :)

Hope to see you there in a few weeks, when we have some episodes set up!

*and then six months passed*
Just to let anyone reading this know: We do not have episodes set up. As is the case with most podcasts, this one failed to get off the ground much. I'm going to make a postmortem once (... if?) my /new/ podcast comes out. :p
