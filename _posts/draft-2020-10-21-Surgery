The act of being trans in society at this time is one of constant pain; of feeling like there's something itching slightly beyond my ken, and being unable to scratch it.
The state of medicine these days is ridiculous; there are so many things we can to to live better, happier, more full. And one of these things is surgeries in order to replace or transform organs to make them conform to the gender of the person getting the surgery.
But these surgeries are done by tons of people who all have different strategies. They're not all ... great, much of the time. There's a lot of things that are done differently, or things that can be wrong from one surgeon whereas another would be fine.
Surgeries can leave large, visible scars from some surgeons, whereas others will have small ones and good results. You can look at other results and ask people in order to figure out what would be best, but in the end it's all a bit of a guessing game.
One just hopes you pick the right thing with the information you have at the time.
I've had two of these so far. One was with someone who's done hundreds of surgeries like this. Another was with someone who'd done around 20. The second one was much worse, and now I'm going to have to get revision of some sort. There are scars around my face.
To be honest, other than the scars I don't necessarily hate the look. But the scars will be there regardless. You'd think - or hope - that people can all do these surgeries the same, or close to it. It doesn't seem too difficult in theory to have things in common.
And yet, here we are.
