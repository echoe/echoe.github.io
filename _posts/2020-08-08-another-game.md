I wrote a new - new game, for Narrascope's Game Jam (a Narrative Fiction weeklong meeting of people who write and consume it). It's 15,000 words, and has statistics you tweak by making choices, and various things you can unlock.

I made this earlier, but forgot to post about it here. Time passes, heh. :p
The content is perhaps a bit ... juvenile and dreamlike, but I'm proud of it regardless - I wrote 10,000 words in 6 hours to get it finished under the deadline, and even though it shipped with massive bugs I fixed the bugs directy after the deadline (I wasn't two hours late! Ignore that! Bah) and have a playable game that I enjoy reading when I play it myself - that takes over 15 minutes to play by oneself! That's all you can really ask for from a game jam, I think. :)
Hoping to branch into RenPy or Unity in the near future.
