So I've been working in tech for a long while now. Over ten years! That's seventy in dog years!!!!!!
And one thing I've noticed is that, especially when you immediately get into tech, there's a lot of concern over the exact tools you're using. The impact of choosing python over ruby, the weight of choosing a blue skies project vs. brown skies (what an image). But ... after working on some of these projects, I honestly don't think it matters overmuch.

I'll always emphasize the importance of choosing the right tool for the job, and making sure that we're doing the correct thing. But the actual attitude of the people working on the problem, and whether or not everyone is on the right page, matters so much more than things like the tools and the sanity of the person who initially designed something.

With the right surroundings, you can make anything "portable enough". And with the right group of people, planning and time, you can move mountains. And without those ... nothing will happen.

This is just something I've noticed. The actual attitude of the team and the people within it matters much more than the problem they're actually solving. Call it a hot take, but I haven't seen it proved false yet, and I've been around for a while. :)
