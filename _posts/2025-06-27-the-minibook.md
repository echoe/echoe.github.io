There's a thing my friends have noticed about me: I buy laptops. It's the thing I do, more than anything else, that makes me subject to capitalism.
I had a Macbook Air M1 and ended up selling it because of the lack of customizability.
After trying a few other laptops, I got a Surface Laptop 7, which I'd used as my main laptop for a good year.
It's fantastic, but there are some software compatibility issues I've run into that have made it a little more frustrating than I'd like ... and now the Framework Laptop 12 is coming out, so I made plans to switch to that.
But then I put a bid on this laptop on eBay called the Chuwi Minibook X. And my bid was accepted, even though it dropped the price ... really low.
It arrived here and I've used it for four days, so here are my current thoughts:

- The keyboard is cramped. It works, it's the best you could possibly do in the form factor, but still. Not really a fan, sadly.
- The rest of it is surprisingly good. It doesn't open one-handed, but it feels very satisfying to open and close. The touchscreen isn't amazing, but it's acceptable.
- The battery life is 4-5 hours for me, with it idling in front of me playing light games on Windows. (It gives off much less heat on Ubuntu, and everything works immediately aside from the grub screen being sideways!)
- It's so small. This whole laptop is lighter and smaller than my 11" ipad pro and magic keyboard, which is what I was bringing with me before.
- And it was $200??? How?

This isn't going to be my forever laptop unless I do some amazing job of adjusting ... The kayboard is just too small and it bothers me.
But it's great, and I wish I could keep using it. And for the money ... I don't know what's better.

... Anyways. Totally unrelated to anything, but here are my thoughts on a very small piece of tech.
