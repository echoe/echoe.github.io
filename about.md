subtitle: Who is Iris Felshman???

Who am I? Well ... I'm a person! A person who, in fact, does many things. You can read about some of them here. Wow!

### My skills
I write, I make music, I make Youtube Videos, and I code. Not necessarily in that order! (Actually, in terms of societal worth, that order's almost exactly backwards!) But I want to do all of them, and I do, to the best of my ability ...

### What are your musical inspirations?
Imagine Hayley Kiyoko, Noah Kagan, and Flying Lotus combined somehow. That's my musical goal. I listen to and enjoy a massive list of artists but listnig them all here seems like the height of futility. :)

### What are your gaming inspirations?
If I could just replay Butterfly Soup every day for the rest of my life, I'd probably be happy. But eventually I'd make an extension where I could play as the goose from Untitled Goose Game, and every scene was just me honking in vain at the other protagonists.
I also play League of Legends. Way too much of it. I'm trying to play more narrative games, but it's difficult to do that sometimes.

### Who are your writing inspirations?

David Foster Wallace inspired me a /lot/ when I was younger, and he still does today, despite the problems he's had. Ursula K. LeGuin is fantastic, I also read a lot of Kurt Vonnegut ... K.A. Applegate as well. William Gibson is fantastic and Pattern Recognition is one of my favorite books. Franz Kafka and Vladomir Nabokov were also massive influences. Cory Doctorow. Emily Dickinson, whose name I can never spell right. Neil Stevenson. e.e. cummings.
... I've listed enough writers here, right? I want to add more but that's not necessarily ... useful.

### Who are your coding inspirations?

I'll be honest, I don't think I have specific inspirations in regards to coding or designing systems! It's a thing that I'm more ... primally driven to do; when I see things that are wrong, I need to fix them. There are definitely people I've worked with who I try to emulate parts of their working strategies and approaches, but I'm not going to name non-famous people here.

### Oh, okay. Well ... what do you enjoy coding, and how?
I enjoy making scripts that make things I'm doing already go better. I would say I do less coding right now, and more ... designing systems to make things easier, whether that's coding or something else. Measure twice, cut once! I write a lot of terraform code, some Python code, work within AWS ... organize configurations and ensure that the method by which we're installing services works, write a lot of Dockerfiles and Jenkins files, etc. In general, just ... trying to use the right tool for the right job. And trying to convince others to do the same.

It's pretty tiring, though! I wish I could write more non-code things, but after coding/being the DevOps Holder of Many Hats, my brain tends to, ah, go 'splat'. Which isn't very conducive to writing.

### Let's wrap this up. What else do you want to say?

Nothing, really. Hope this finds you well. :)
